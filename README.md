Object detection has many use cases in the recent days and in the future,this model is basic and may be used in my future projects too.

files:
1) video_object_detection.ipynb : This  is esentially our main file that we will be using to detect objects.
2) traffic-mini  :this is our input video.
3) traffic_detected and video_frame_analysis1 :these are our output videos.

Interaction with the project :
 Just run the video_object_detection.ipynb, everything runs smooth if you have installed all the essential libraries.
